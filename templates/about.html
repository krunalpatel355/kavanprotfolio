                    <div class="about-text">
                        <p>Hi! I'm Kavan Gajjar, a video editor, motion designer, and 3D artist with a passion for bringing ideas to life through visual storytelling. With expertise in Adobe Premiere, After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Maya, I specialize in crafting compelling visuals that leave a lasting impact.</p>
                        <p>My creative journey started with Truyar Entertainers, a YouTube channel I co-founded, where I honed my skills in video production, editing, and audience engagement. Since then, I've collaborated with brands like Gokul Jewellers, SteelHacks Industries, and Rudraksh, helping them build strong visual identities through video content, motion graphics, and social media marketing.</p>
                        <p>Beyond editing, I have a deep interest in 3D modeling and animation, constantly exploring new ways to blend creativity with technology. My goal is to push the boundaries of storytelling, whether through dynamic motion graphics, immersive 3D visuals, or high-quality cinematic edits.</p>
